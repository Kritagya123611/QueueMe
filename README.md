## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- ESLint

- SWC or Babel (for Fast Refresh)

## Getting Started

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with hot module replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

If you're developing a production application, it's recommended to use TypeScript with type-aware lint rules. See the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to get started.
